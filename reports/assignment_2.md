Q1. What are 2 things that you learned from this assignment?
A1. In Assignment 2 I understood about the concepts of polling and Semaphores.The concepts are easy to understand theoratically but not practically I felt the examples were vague and not sufficient to actually implement, more example and reference docs would have really helped especially in the case of polling.I have started gaining richer experience in problem solving and while solving this assignment i have spent maximum time on understanding why its not happening the way it supposed to and started figuring out the actual definitions through a practical approach.

Q2. What are 2 mistakes that you made in this assignment, and how did you discover and fix these mistakes?
A2. In the beginning when I have started to do my assignment i thought that it is not feasible to achieve the desired result using a single process but later upon implementing the assignment with two process using the concepts that i have observed in producer and consumer problem,I found that it is feasible to achieve with single process. thanks to some of the hints provided in Assignment 2 Wiki.

I have done lots of trials and errors in the beginning to understand about the concepts of semaphores and polling even now i am looking for the actual definition of polling so that i can validate with mine.
while I am implementing polling logic in the assignment my idea about volatile was completely different and it took some time and lots of discussions with the classmates helped me to understood the meaning of volatile.


Q3. If you were restarting this assignment, what would you change about how you went about completing this assignment?
A3. I would have started studying the concepts and implement few examples in hand before i actually start beginning this assignment.The assignment is challenging and is tricky has to be observed at every single step.If i had done above things i mentioned in the beginning i would have saved lot of time solving the problem.

At one point of time my process are not even terminating and some times i have recieved segmentation Errors followed by overlapping results.It took some time for me to understand and fix them.If I know about them in the beginning it would have realy helped me a lot.
