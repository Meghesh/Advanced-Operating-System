# Assignment 7 

## Task 1:
Redesign and modify the Xinu operating system so it closes all files that have been opened by a process when the
process terminates.

## Task 2:
The number of index blocks is important because having too many wastes space that could be used for data, while having too few means data blocks will be wasted because there are insufficient index blocks to use them. Given that there are 16 data block pointers in an index block and 7 index blocks fill a disk block, how many index blocks might be needed for a disk of n total blocks if the directory can hold k files?
